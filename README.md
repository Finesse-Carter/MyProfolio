#  MyProfolio
## I come from a family of builders, my parents were union carpenters and I worked as a union laborer for 6 years. However, I needed a creative outlet and wanted to grow outside the rigid world of construction. So in 2016, I launched an online clothing line, which was my first introduction to code, designing and building a website for the clothes I designed. I fell in love with it!
